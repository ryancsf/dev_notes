## UI/UX Notes

1. Don't just plainly rely on font sizes. Use lighter colors to deemphasize other elements. Use heavier font-weight to emphasize/highlight important bits.
2. Making the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create
   hierarchy, not making it light grey.
3. For text on colored background, Choose a color with the same hue, and adjust the saturation and lightness until it looks right to you.
4. Design features, not layout.
5. Before start, define systems for font size, font weight, padding, margin, opacity. All of this to avoid low level decisions.
6. Avoid Labels
7. If labels are absolutely necessary, de-emphasize it by using smaller font and lighter colors. De-emphasize the label by making it smaller, reducing the contrast, using a lighter font weight, or some combination of all three.
8. Visual Hierarchy !== Semantic Hierarchy
9. Deemphasize icons by lowering the contrast of the icon by giving it a softer color
10. Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions.
11. When you take a hierarchy-first approach to designing the actions on page, the result is a much less busy UI that communicates more clearly:
12. A better approach is to start by giving something way too much space, then remove it until it you’re happy with the result.
13. Creating a spacing and sizing system isn’t quite as simple as something like “make sure everything is a multiple of 4px” — a naive approach like that doesn’t make it any easier to choose between 120px and 125px.
